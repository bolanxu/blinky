# Blinky

A small figdet project I made 7th grade year as a birthday gift for a friend.

A very small and simple toy that repeats the pattern of tones and lights that you input into it. At the core is an 8-pin microcontroller called the STC15W204S, which
is part of the 8051 microcontroller family developed by Intel in the 80's. But a company named STC Microcontrollers decided to continue development on it with
added features such as ADC, more timers, PWM, SPI, and others. This was the first microcontroller I learned (I should have learned Arduino first) and one of the first
projects I made with it.

I don't have an image of it sadly because the only prototype I built I gave to my friend. When I get a chance, I will try to get one. But here is a look at the schematic
and pcb designs designed in Autodesk EAGLE.
